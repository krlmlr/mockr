The mockr package helps testing code that relies on functions that are slow, have unintended side effects or access resources that may not be available when testing.
It allows replacing such functions with deterministic [*mock functions*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object).
This article gives an overview and introduces a few techniques.

```{r setup}
library(mockr)
```

## General idea

## Create demo package

## Slow function with side effect

## Adding test with mock

## Run all tests in package

## Run individual tests

## Write wrapper functions

## Mock S3 methods
